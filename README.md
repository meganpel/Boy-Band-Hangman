# Boy Band Hangman

Boy Band Hangman tests your knowledge of boy bands from the ‘80s and ‘90s. The game gives you the letters and spaces and the user will have ten guesses to solve the boy band puzzle - letter by letter. When the boy band is revealed, an image will appear. If the puzzle is successfully solved, a music clip will play when the photo displays!
